# ML-MODEL
HighRadius is a B2B company. The following AI model was generated using the training provided by HighRadius. 
The clients of highradius are given a specific date on which they have to make the payment for the order. 
But incase the client makes a delayed payment; We have to predict the delayed date at which the client will make the payment using the said AI Model. 
I used Random Forest Classifier to predict the dependent variable and generate output.
