# ML-MODEL
The following ML model was generated using supervised learning. 
The clients of are given a specific date on which they have to make the payment for the order. 
But incase the client makes a delayed payment; We have to predict the delayed date at which the client will make the payment using the said ML Model. 
I used Random Forest Classifier to predict the dependent variable and generate output.
